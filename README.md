# Codewords
This project is a LUA script written for [Tabletop Simulator](https://www.tabletopsimulator.com). Please note that this repository only contains the source code for the project and does not include the corresponding assets.

## Getting Started
If you'd like to help contribute to the project, please ensure you have the following prerequisites:

* [Tabletop Simulator Game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
  * [TTS Atom plugin](https://github.com/Berserk-Games/atom-tabletopsimulator-lua/wiki/Installation)
  
Once you have everything set up, you can get started working on the project via the following guidelines:
1. Subscribe to the [Codewords workshop mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1370354402).
2. Start Tabletop Simulator.
3. Open up Atom (with the TTS plugin already installed).
4. Create a new server.
5. Load the workshop mod (Games > Workshop > Codewords).
6. Open up Atom. The script should already be loaded in the editor. If not, use the `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `L` key combination to get LUA scripts from the game.
7. Clone the repository and copy the contents of the files from the repository into their respectively named files on your local instance.
